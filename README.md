*<p align="center">💫  I'm passionate about challenges, I'm always looking to learn something new and think a little outside the box, in a good way. It's quite possible to find myself developing projects with Arduino, these projects help me learn both programming and electronics. Here you will find my work and academic activities and some projects I do during the holidays.💫 </p>*
